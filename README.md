# The_C#_Wall
Coding Dojo assignment

A very clean message Wall with nested Razor partials where Users can Comment on eachothers Messages.
When a User wants to leave a Comment on a Message they click a button to uncollapse a textfield form and currently the form appears on every Message on the Wall.¯\_(ツ)_/¯
